This is the description of an experimental project of mine: A DCC interior light board compatible with Kato's N-gauge EMUs.

Summary of the project:
- DCC Light Board based on the Microchip ATtiny1616 MCU
- DCC tested from 12V to 18V
- Energy storage / Antiflicker / Keep Alive: 1200uF
- Programmable light brightness with LED luminance table
- Programmable CCT (Correlated Colour Temperature), continuously between 3000K (warm white) and 6500K (cool white), using two sets of 8 LEDs: 8 x 3000K and 8 x 6500K
- Two sets of parameters Light brightness, CCT and Function Control, for day / night modes
